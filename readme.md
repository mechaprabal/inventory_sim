# Fixed-order Quantity Inventory Model Simulation

This repository contains a Monte Carlo simulation for the
fixed-order quantity inventory model.

The developed model is available as a Flask application for executing the simulation.

This inventory model was discussed in an online NPTEL course titled, **"Advanced Business Decision Support Systems"**.
